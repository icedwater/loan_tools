# LoanTools

I'm starting this repo with a quick and dirty script to find the number of
months it takes to pay off a HDB loan. This will be a good excuse to write
tests, GUIs, and do collaboration.

Instead I decided to add more utility calculations tools, beginning with a
power bill and water bill calculator. I really need to focus. Or get other
people to help writing these other components.

## Python versions

This is written in Python 2.7.9 because it's what I found on Ubuntu 15.04.
Some of it might be 2.7.3 or 2.7.11. I need to make sure it's compatible.
